Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, imposing significant burdens on societies and individuals. Despite advances in screening and treatment, the economic and personal toll of cancer remains substantial. Prognostic modeling plays a crucial role in cancer care, but current models often focus on short-term risks rather than long-term outcomes. This study aims to address this gap by developing and validating a predictive model that accurately forecasts the 5-year risk of death in cancer survivors, using data from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
